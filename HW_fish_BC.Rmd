You want to know the density of fish in a set of experimental ponds

You observe the following counts in ten ponds: 5,6,7,3,6,5,8,4,4,3

Let 

$x = (5,6,7,3,6,5,8,4,4,3)$

$\mu =$ mean 

$n = 10$ number of samples

Process Model:  $f(x)=\mu$


Data model: Poisson Distribution: $P(x) = \prod_i^10 \frac{\mu^x e^{-\mu}}{x_i!}$
  
Solution for the analytical MLE

$\ln(P(x)) = \sum_i^{n} \ln(\mu) -n\mu - \sum_1^{n} \log(x!)\\ 
\frac{\partial \ln(P(x))}{\partial \mu} = -n + \frac{\sum_1^{n}x_i}{\mu}$

Set

$-n + \frac{\sum_1^{n}x_i}{n} = 0\\ \Rightarrow \hat{\mu} =  \frac{\sum_1^{n}x_i}{n} = 5.1$

Thus the estimated mean of this population is 5.1 

```{r}
obs = sort(c(5,6,7,3,6,5,8,4,4,3))
hist(obs,c(.5,1.5,2.5,3.5,4.5,5.5,6.5,7.5,8.5), freq=FALSE,
     main="Histogram of observed fish counts and density function of population",
     xlab = "Number of fish")
mu = sum(obs)/length(obs)
x = 0:9
lines(x,dpois(x,mu),type='s',col=2)
```
